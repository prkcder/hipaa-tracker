some notes

# For development (with live reload):
docker build -t myapp-dev --target dev .
docker run -v $(pwd):/app -p 3000:3000 -p 8080:8080 myapp-dev

# For production:
docker build -t myapp-prod --target production .
docker run -p 8080:8080 myapp-prod



# target: backend-builder
issue of why it never ran correctly
The backend-builder stage is never meant to be a target - it's just the build step that both dev and production stages use.


Base + Override approach:

docker-compose.yml = base configuration
docker-compose.override.yml = your development setup (auto-loaded)
docker-compose.prod.yml = production setup


Base + Explicit files approach:

docker-compose.yml = base configuration
docker-compose.dev.yml = development setup (explicit)
docker-compose.prod.yml = production setup



The docker-compose.dev.yml is used when:

You want to be explicit about which environment you're running
You have multiple development configurations (e.g., dev, dev-debug, dev-testing)
You're working in a team where everyone needs to use the same explicit commands

For Your Use Case:
I'd recommend the Override approach:
bash# Development (automatic)
docker-compose up

# Production (explicit)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
Bottom line: docker-compose.dev.yml and docker-compose.override.yml serve the same purpose - they're just different ways to organize your development configuration. Pick one approach and stick with it!
Most developers prefer the override approach because it's less typing for daily development work.

Docker Compose File Structure
1. docker-compose.yml (Base Configuration)
yamlservices:
  backend:
    build: 
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8000:8080"
    env_file:
      - .env
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=myapp
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - ./scripts/seed_db.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/seed_db.sql
    
volumes:
  postgres_data:
2. docker-compose.dev.yml (Development Overrides)
yamlservices:
  backend:
    build:
      target: dev  # Use the dev stage with hot reloading
    volumes:
      - .:/app  # Mount source code for live changes
      - /app/node_modules  # Exclude node_modules
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    command: ["air"]  # Override to use air for hot reloading
    
  # Add frontend for development
  frontend:
    build: 
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      target: frontend-builder
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./web:/app/web
      - /app/web/node_modules
    working_dir: /app/web
    command: ["npm", "run", "dev"]
3. docker-compose.prod.yml (Production Overrides)
yamlservices:
  backend:
    build:
      target: production  # Or omit target to use final stage
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    # Remove volume mounts (use built-in files)
    
  db:
    restart: unless-stopped
    # In production, you might use managed DB instead
4. docker-compose.override.yml (Auto-loaded Development)
yaml# This file is automatically loaded by docker-compose
# Use this for your default development setup
services:
  backend:
    build:
      target: dev
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    command: ["air"]
Usage Commands:
Development (3 options):
Option 1: Using override file (automatic)
bashdocker-compose up  # Automatically uses docker-compose.override.yml
Option 2: Explicit dev file
bashdocker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
Option 3: Set environment variable
bashCOMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.dev.yml docker-compose up
Production:
bashdocker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
Testing (base only):
bashdocker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up  # Uses production build
Recommended Approach:

Use docker-compose.override.yml for your main development workflow
Keep base docker-compose.yml clean and environment-agnostic
Use explicit -f flags when you need specific environments

For your current workflow:
Since you're developing, create a docker-compose.override.yml with the dev target, and just run:
bashdocker-compose up
This automatically combines the base file with your override file!








🔨 Phase 1: Scaffolding & Infrastructure
Step	Task	Description
1	📁 Create Project Structure	Create folders above in hipaa-tracker/
2	🐳 Write Dockerfile	Use golang:1.22-alpine image with COPY . /app and set up Go build/run
3	🐳 Add docker-compose.yml	Spin up: Go backend, Postgres, and optional Adminer
4	🐘 Initialize Postgres	Write init.sql or use migrations (for stretch) to create a basic events table
5	🧪 Write .env file	Store secrets like DB connection info
6	🧱 Run go mod init github.com/yourname/hipaa-tracker	Initialize Go modules
7	✅ Test Docker Build	Run docker-compose up --build and fix any issues early

👨‍💻 Phase 2: Start With Backend (Recommended)
Backend first gives you an API to test the frontend against. Focus on:

Step	Task	Description
8	✨ main.go	Set up simple HTTP server on :8080 with one route /track
9	📦 handler.go	Create handler for POST /track, decode JSON event
10	🔐 sanitizer.go	Read sensitive_fields.yaml, strip them from incoming data
11	📨 forwarder.go	Simulate forwarding to 3rd party (e.g., log to file or dummy URL)
12	🧠 storage.go	Save sanitized event to Postgres
13	✅ Test /track (named it event so change if needed) with curl/postman	Send sample payload and confirm sanitization, DB save, forward works
14	🧪 Write unit tests	For sanitizer and handler logic (basic coverage)

🌐 Phase 3: Frontend UI
Step	Task	Description
15	🧱 index.html	Simple form: name, email, activity type, timestamp
16	💬 events.js	On submit: send POST to /track using fetch
17	🧪 Local test	Load index.html via Live Server or serve via Go and confirm event hits backend

🧠 Phase 4: Stretch Goals
Step	Task	Description
18	🔍 Web UI for viewing events	Add /events endpoint in Go + template rendering OR separate viewer in frontend
19	✅ Adminer or pgweb	Add UI to explore Postgres data easily
20	⚙️ Configurable sanitizer	Use sensitive_fields.yaml to control what’s stripped
21	🚀 Simulate AWS forward	Use dummy SNS or SQS endpoint and log success/failures
22	🔍 Add logging	Add structured logging with request/response logs and error handling
23	🧪 More tests	Add table-driven tests for edge cases in sanitization or error flows
24	📜 Polish README	Add usage steps, stack explanation, and sample payloads

🪄 Bonus (Optional Polish):
Add Swagger/OpenAPI spec for the /track endpoint

Deploy to Render or Railway (Postgres + Go free tier)

Use environment-based config (prod, dev, etc.)

Include basic auth or API key protection for /track

💡 Tech Stack Summary (Resume / Readme-Friendly)
Golang: Backend service for privacy-preserving event tracking

PostgreSQL: Stores sanitized event data

TypeScript / JS: Frontend for generating and submitting events

Docker / Docker Compose: Containerized dev and deployment environment

Optional AWS Sim: Mimic HIPAA-compliant forwarding logic

Bonus Testing: Go unit tests using built-in testing package




If You Presented This to Freshpaint...
Strengths:

Thoughtful Go + Postgres architecture

Strong understanding of data privacy and event pipelines

Structured, testable, Dockerized project

Aligned with their domain + tech stack

Bonus: frontend + CLI integration can be added incrementally

Tips for Demo:

Talk about why you chose redaction via YAML (flexible, product-like config)

Show how the sanitizer, DB, and forwarder represent key parts of an analytics pipeline

Offer ideas like retroactive sanitization or multi-destination forwarding to show forward-thinking

✅ Summary
Yes — this project absolutely aligns with Freshpaint’s mission, tech stack, and domain. It’s not just a random project; it’s a strategic prototype of what their backend engineers likely build and improve every day.

You're building something useful, extensible, and aligned — and that’s exactly what you'd want to present.



[curl POST /event]  http request
        ↓
[handler: NewEventHandler()]
        ↓
[Sanitize payload using sanitize.Sanitize()]
        ↓
[Store to DB using storage.SaveEvent()]
        ↓
[Forward event using forwarder.ForwardEvent()]
        ↓
[Return JSON response to client] response

3. Storage to Database

  The sanitized input is sent to storage.SaveEvent()

  That function handles the DB logic (calling INSERT INTO events (...))

  But there’s a key step here:

      Go doesn’t allow storing map[string]interface{} directly into Postgres

      So in storage.go, it marshals the payload to JSON before inserting:

payloadJSON, _ := json.Marshal(event.Payload)
// Then insert payloadJSON (as []byte) into Postgres

✅ Output: Row is stored in Postgres with sanitized JSON and timestamp
📤 4. Forwarding Simulation

    After successful DB insert, your event is passed to forwarder.ForwardEvent()

    This just logs it for now (but could later hit a real endpoint):

log.Printf("📤 Forwarding event ID %d (type: %s, sanitized: %v)", ...)

✅ Output: Logged to console (or sent externally in Phase 3)
